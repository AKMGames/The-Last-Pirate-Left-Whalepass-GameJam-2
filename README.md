# About the game

**The Last Pirate Left** is a retro-style game made in just one week for [$2,500 Whalepass GameJam! #2](https://itch.io/jam/2500-whalepass-gamejam-2)

Your mission is to fight the bad pirates and save the governor's  daughter.

The game is fun but challenging, with a reward system to unlock skins using the [Whalepass.gg](https://www.whalepass.gg/) API to save progress. 

You can claim your rewards on [Discover.games](https://www.discover.games/) by clicking on the Discover my rewards button in the Skins Page.

The game may have some bugs due to the short development time.
